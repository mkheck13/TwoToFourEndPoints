## Mini Challenge: TwoToFour - EndPoints
## Design an API with 3 endpoints:each endpoint must have their own Controller file, inside the Controller folder. Also, each one must  have their own service file, inside a Service folder.
##  Peer Reviewer: Aiden Foo
##  Peer Review: Each Endpoint works well and took each input I gave, the only thing I would change about the code is that the two questions allows for numbers over 12 so the time we wake up could be "24" which isn't really a valid time to wake up. It's a very simple fix to make. it also allows numbers to be the name which is also a simple fix. There's also the issue where when testing in postman, the links that corrispond with the endpoints don't allow for the numbers to be inputed, which is also a quick fix (just adding /x/y to the end of the areas that need it) The other fields give an error when you input something other than an integer so other then that and the "TwoQuestions" endpoint, it is good.
